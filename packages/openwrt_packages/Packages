Description:  takes a list of prefixes in conventional format on stdin, and performs two
 optimisations to reduce the length of the prefix list. It removes any
 supplied prefixes which are supurfluous because they are already included in
 another supplied prefix (e.g., 203.97.2.0/24 would be removed if
 203.97.0.0/17 was also supplied), and identifies adjacent prefixes that can
 be combined under a single, shorter-length prefix (e.g., 203.97.2.0/24 and
 203.97.3.0/24 can be combined into the single prefix 203.97.2.0/23).

 .
 Take care that you don't include apache at the moment into your image
 please select it only as module because busybox will override
 /usr/sbin/httpd. It'll be solved soon. If you need to include this
 package in the image anyway, remove httpd from busybox
 (Base system --> Configuration --> Networking Utilities --> httpd).
 Also you should take care for the initscripts, apache's httpd isn't
 compatible with the one from busybox, so if you want to use apache
 for running your webif, you'll need to change the parameters in the
 scripts and configure the rest in /etc/httpd.conf.

Description:  Alarm Pinger (apinger) is a little tool which monitors various IP devices by
 simple ICMP echo requests. There are various other tools, that can do this,
 but most of them are shell or perl scripts, spawning many processes, thus much
 CPU-expensive, especially when one wants continuous monitoring and fast
 response on target failure.  Alarm Pinger is a single program written in C, so
 it doesn't need much CPU power even when monitoring many targets with frequent
 probes.  Alarm Pinger supports both IPv4 and IPv6. The code have been tested
 on Linux and FreeBSD.

Description:  libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the
 terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections and
 (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other
 sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted
 strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include
 statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability
 to a program using a simple API.
 
 The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser
 library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use
 and quick to integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg
 before, but was changed to not confuse with other similar libraries.

Description:  Conserver is an application that allows multiple users to watch a
 serial console at the same time.  It can log the data, allows users
 to take write-access of a console (one at a time), and has a
 variety of bells and whistles to accentuate that basic
 functionality.  The idea is that conserver will log all your serial
 traffic so you can go back and review why something crashed, look
 at changes (if done on the console), or tie the console logs into a
 monitoring system (just watch the logfiles it creates).  With
 multi-user capabilities you can work on equipment with others,
 mentor, train, etc.  It also does all that client-server stuff so
 that, assuming you have a network connection, you can interact with
 any of the equipment from home or wherever.

Description:  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the HTTP-protocol,
 allows authoring of resources on a remote web server.davfs2 provides the ability to
 access such resources like a typical filesystem, allowing for use by standard
 applications with no built-in support for WebDAV.
 
 davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of Unix-like
 systems (mount, umount, etc.). davfs2 makes mounting by unprivileged users as easy
 and secure as possible.
 
 davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive, to avoid
 unnecessary network traffic and to prevent data loss, and to cope for slow or
 unreliable connections.
 
 davfs2 will work with most WebDAV servers needing little or no configuration.

Description:  This program forwards DHCP messages between subnets with different sublayer
 broadcast domains. It is similarly to the DHCP relay agent dhcrelay of ISC's
 DHCP, but has the following features which are important for me:
 
 - Runs as non-root in a chroot-jail
 - Uses "normal" AF_INET sockets; this allows to uses packetfilters to filter
 incoming messages.
 - The DHCP agent IDs can be defined freely
 - Has a small memory footprint when using dietlibc
 
 It tries to be RFC 2131/2132 and 3046 compliant. Probably it works with BOOTP
 (RFC 951) also, but since the handling of the giaddr field is described
 misleading (see RFC 1542), there may occur problems.

Description:  Fwknop implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet Authorization
 (SPA) for Linux systems running iptables.  This mechanism requires only a
 single encrypted and non-replayed packet to communicate various pieces of

 application of this program is to use iptables in a default-drop stance to
 protect services such as SSH with an additional layer of security in order to
 make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much
 more difficult.
 This package contains the fwknop client.

Description:  The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive.
 
 Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
 multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
 machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
 of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
 that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 
 This package provides the documentation for the Go programming language.

 binary, Rockwell binary, Garmin binary format, or other vendor binary
 protocols.  gpsd takes this information from the GPS and translates it into
 something uniform and easier to understand for clients.
 This package contains auxiliary tools and example clients for monitoring and

Description:  The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX
 systems. It is configurable by XML files. The KLISH stands for Kommand
 Line Interface Shell.
 The klish is a fork of clish 0.7.3 developed by Graeme McKerrell.
 It defines new features but it's compatible (as much as possible) with
 clish's XML configuration files.
 klish is able to run using clish XML configuration files although
 current clish users may expect some changes in behavior.
 Konf and konfd are klish utilities that are used to store configuration
 informations in a way which is similar to what's found on CISCO devices.
 More information about these tools is to be found on the klish web site.

Description:  LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program with command line interface. It supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS and FTPS protocols. GNU Readline library is used for input.
 Every operation in lftp is reliable, that is any non-fatal error is handled and the operation is retried automatically. So if downloading breaks, it will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if ftp server does not support REST command, lftp will try to retrieve the file from the very beginning until the file is transferred completely. This is useful for dynamic-ip machines which change their IP addresses quite often, and for sites with very bad internet connectivity.
 
 lftp has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several commands in parallel in background (&). It is also possible to group commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs are executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some commands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command. Commands can be executed conditionally based on termination status of previous command (&&, ||).
 
 lftp has builtin mirror which can download or update a whole directory tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or updates a directory tree on server.

Description:  libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 - A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure of a process
 - A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to Syslog or STDERR
 - An API for writing PID files
 - An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with select() or poll()
 - An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 
 APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not that
 simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

Description:  The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to
 various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to call any function
 specified by a call interface description at run-time.
 
 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface is the
 popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call
 code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
 lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
 A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
 between the two languages.

Description:  Fwknop implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet Authorization
 (SPA) for Linux systems running iptables.  This mechanism requires only a
 single encrypted and non-replayed packet to communicate various pieces of
 information including desired access through an iptables policy. The main
 application of this program is to use iptables in a default-drop stance to
 protect services such as SSH with an additional layer of security in order to
 make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much
 more difficult.
 This package contains the libfko shared library.

Description:  gpsd is a userland daemon acting as a translator between GPS and AIS receivers
 and their clients. gpsd listens on port 2947 for clients requesting
 position/time/velocity information.  The receivers are expected to generate
 position information in a well-known format -- as NMEA-0183 sentences, SiRF
 binary, Rockwell binary, Garmin binary format, or other vendor binary
 protocols.  gpsd takes this information from the GPS and translates it into
 something uniform and easier to understand for clients.

Description:  OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
 devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual
 filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
 properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read
 and written.
 
 Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a
 consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a
 software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are
 some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,
 parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
 Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness
 rather than speed.
 
 This package contains the OWFS C-API library.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains a shared library, used by other programs.

Description:  NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc.
 NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
 Sodium is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221), with a compatible API.
 The design choices, particularly in regard to the Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman function, emphasize security (whereas NIST curves emphasize "performance" at the cost of security), and "magic constants" in NaCl/Sodium have clear rationales.
 The same cannot be said of NIST curves, where the specific origins of certain constants are not described by the standards.
 And despite the emphasis on higher security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.

Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

Description:  mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
 shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-
 milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh
 derivate currently being actively developed.  It includes bug
 fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
 robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in substring operations and the Emacs
 editing mode) and - while R50 corresponds to OpenBSD 5.5-cur-
 rent ksh (without GNU bash-like PS1 and fancy character clas-
 ses) - adheres to SUSv4 and is much more robust. The code has
 been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli-
 ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi-
 lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own)
 are available. It has sensible defaults as usual with BSD.

 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.

 upsmon is the client process that is responsible for the most important
 part of UPS monitoring--shutting down the system when the power goes
 out. It can call out to other helper programs for notification purposes
 during power events. upsmon can monitor multiple systems using a single
 process. Every UPS that is defined in the upsmon.conf configuration file
 is assigned a power value and a type (slave or master).

Description:  OpenOCD provides on-chip programming and debugging support with a
 layered architecture of JTAG interface and TAP support including:
 
 - (X)SVF playback to facilitate automated boundary scan and FPGA/CPLD
 programming;
 - debug target support (e.g. ARM, MIPS): single-stepping,
 breakpoints/watchpoints, gprof profiling, etc;
 - flash chip drivers (e.g. CFI, NAND, internal flash);
 - embedded TCL interpreter for easy scripting.
 
 Several network interfaces are available for interacting with OpenOCD:
 telnet, TCL, and GDB. The GDB server enables OpenOCD to function as a
 "remote target" for source-level debugging of embedded systems using

Description:  OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
 devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual
 filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
 properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read
 and written.
 
 Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a
 consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a
 software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are
 some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,
 parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
 Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness
 rather than speed.

Description:  procps is a set of command line and full-screen utilities that provide information out of the pseudo-filesystem
 most commonly located at /proc. This filesystem provides a simple interface to the kernel data structures.
 The programs of procps generally concentrate on the structures that describe the processess running on the system.
 
 NOTE: some utilities provided by procps-ng packages (ps, uptime, kill, ...) are installed as busybox applets, by default.
 Conflicting applets should be removed from the build to avoid file conflicts.

Description:  This tool can be described as a Tiny, Dirty, Linux-and-OSX-Only
 C command that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar,
 gzip/gunzip, cat, etc.) currently running on your system and
 displays the percentage of copied data. It can also show estimated
 time and throughput, and provide a "top-like" mode (monitoring).
 .
 It simply scans `/proc` for interesting commands, and then looks at
 directories `fd` and `fdinfo` to find opened files and seek positions,
 and reports status for the largest file.
 .
 It's very light, and compatible with virtually any command.
 This program was formerly known as 'cv' on github.

Description:  Redsocks is a daemon running on the local system, that will transparently
 tunnel any TCP connection via a remote SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy server. It
 uses the system firewall's redirection facility to intercept TCP connections,
 thus the redirection is system-wide, with fine-grained control, and does
 not depend on LD_PRELOAD libraries.
 
 Redsocks supports tunneling TCP connections and UDP packets. It has
 authentication support for both, SOCKS and HTTP proxies.
 
 Also included is a small DNS server returning answers with the "truncated" flag
 set for any UDP query, forcing the resolver to use TCP.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains the rrdcgi tool used to create web pages containing
 RRD graphs based on templates.

 The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the differences
 between two sets of files across the network link.

Description:  uAnytun is a tiny implementation of SATP the secure anycast tunneling protocol.
 SATP defines a protocol used for communication between any combination of
 unicast and anycast tunnel endpoints.  It has less protocol overhead than
 IPSec in Tunnel mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g.
 ethernet, ip, arp ...). SATP directly includes cryptography and message
 authentication based on the methods used by SRTP.  It is intended to deliver
 a generic, scalable and secure solution for tunneling and relaying of packets
 of any protocol.
 Unlike Anytun which is a full featured implementation uAnytun has no support
 for multiple connections or synchronisation. It is a small single threaded
 implementation intended to act as a client on small platforms.

Description:  udproxy makes it possible to convert UDP IPTV streams into HTTP
 streams which can be viewed even over WLANs. HTTP streams do
 not generate huge amounts of multicast traffic, so a sd stream
 only takes about 300k. Interesting for peoply who have IPTV at
 home and do not want to rent multiple decoders from their
 provider but just use their own streaming client (for example
 popcornhour/mediatomb/vlc).

Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 This package contains the video4linux utilities.

 and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works
 non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having
 logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring
 pages as well as ftp sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of
 archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 This package is built without SSL support.
